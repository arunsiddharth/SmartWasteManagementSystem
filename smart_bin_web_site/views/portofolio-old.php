Under this using an arduino , relay and esp8266, things like fan, light bulb can be controlled. Here I have shown "RGB LED" currently which let's you control LED state(1 for ON and 0 for OFF) and color remotely.<br><br>

A small security system aka Burglar Alarm was developed to let user know whether some person tried to access his room in his absence. Under Burglar Alarm Tab,You can set alarm state(ON/OFF) and time in hrs. & minutes for which the alarm should remain active.In case any intruder breaks in, you will get SMS regrading this quickly.<br><br>

Further, a weather station was developed into which data is being sent from sensors like DHT11,LM35 and api(openweathermap) to show current weather conditions of MNIT JAIPUR.<br><br>

EsphaÃ¢ÂÂs main website was used for providing a comfortable user-interface. It allows users to access Internet connected things, Burglar Alarm, and know about current place weather. Website is made secure using login & register options (User can also login via Facebook and G-Mail).<br><br>
